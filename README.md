# How to Use

## Creating a todo list/opening the todo list window
Create a todo list by right clicking in the content browser and selecting the `Todo List` asset under `Miscellaneous`. Open the asset and give your todo list a name. Now go to the `Window` menu dropdown at the top of the editor and select `Todo List`. Your new todo list should show up in the window dropdown.

## Adding/removing tasks
You can add tasks by selecting the `Add Task` button at the bottom of the todo list window, or by double clicking the empty space in the window. You can remove tasks or move tasks by selecting them, right clicking on them to open the context menu, and selecting move or remove.
